              Halal, Will Travel (HHWT). Over the years as a publication, the
              HHWT team has come to realise that many of our readers, like
              yourself, are looking for something more interactive, that will
              enable you to discover new brands and products in just a few
              steps. With that in mind, we spent almost a year planning for this
              new platform that will satisfy your needs - Tribes!

              Yes, they are! Tribes is here to serve the Muslim community and
              therefore, the products listed on our platform are halal. That
              being said, we understand that different individuals have
              different preferences and tolerance levels. As such, we have
              labelled each brand, with the type of halal status that best
              describes them. We advise users to filter and choose the halal
              status based on their comfort level and to dine at their own
              discretion.

              Brand listings are for business owners to promote their new

              As Tribes aims to offer BUSINESS USERS the unique opportunity to
              reach a Muslim audience, we encourage brand owners to claim their
              listing if it is currently available on the platform or create a
              listing if it is not currently available.
